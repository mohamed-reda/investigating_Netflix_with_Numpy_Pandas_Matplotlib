# Project: Netflix Movie Duration Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to our Netflix movie duration analysis project! 
This is a project to investigating Netflix movies length analysis with numpy and pandas to and show the result with matplotlib

We examine trends in Netflix movie durations over the years. Starting with a friend's dataset on average movie durations from 2011 to 2020, our goal is to investigate the claim that Netflix movie durations are declining.

## 1. Loading Data into a Dictionary
We load average movie durations for 2011-2020 into a Python dictionary for initial exploration.

## 2. Creating DataFrame from a Dictionary
Converting the dictionary to a pandas DataFrame enables effective data manipulation and analysis.

## 3. Visual Inspection of Data
A line plot visualizes average movie durations, providing an initial view of the claimed decline.

## 4. Loading Additional Data from CSV
We acquire the original Netflix dataset from a CSV file, inspecting its structure by displaying the first five rows.

## 5. Filtering for Movies
We filter the dataset for movies, selecting key columns like title, country, genre, release year, and duration.

## 6. Creating a Scatter Plot
A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between movie duration and release year, revealing trends over a more extended period.

## 7. Digging Deeper
Filtering for short movies and examining associated genres provides insights into the distribution of movie durations.

## 8. Marking Non-Feature Films
Genres like "Children," "Documentaries," and "Stand-Up" are marked with different colors, enhancing the scatter plot.

## 9. Plotting with Color
Genre-specific coloring highlights the influence of different genres on movie durations.

## 10. What's Next?
Further analyses, statistical exploration, and advanced visualizations can deepen insights into Netflix movie duration trends.

Congratulations on completing the Netflix Movie Duration Analysis project! Further exploration awaits to uncover the dynamics of movie durations in the streaming era.
